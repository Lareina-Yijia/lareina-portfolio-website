        I accidentally saw a post, and someone asked, "Does anyone know the
        name of the safe evacuation of the little green person?" Another
        person replied, "Mr. Picto." This post attracted me and prompted me to
        look up the information. This can be traced back to the 1970s, when
        several large fires broke out in Japanese buildings, and the fire
        department believed that there was a lack of a prominent sign that
        could evacuate people in emergency situations, transforming it into a
        sign for mass mobilization. So Mr. Picto was born.

          The topic I have chosen is mini program games. With so many people playing mini program games nowadays, I
          believe there is a herd effect inside. When you see people around you playing a game, you also want to play
          it, even if you don't really care about it. For example, the popular phrase 'sheep like a sheep'
          Mini program game recently accelerated the
          process of the herd effect, 
          but now it has disappeared.
          So I created a website, when you click on that
          me and prompted me to look up <br>the information.

      Why are simple and easy to use mini pro gram games easily addictive? 
      There is a flow theory in this. I made it into a long strip that explains how
      flow theory and game designers can help you gradually forget about real 
      time and immerse yourself in the game's operations and reasons.

        I made a Flipbook by com- bining "Jump", "2048" and"Sheep" together. I
        have done many books, the common outcome is failure in the challenge,
        and only challenge. Audiences can experience the joy and ten- sion of
        taking a shot during the selection process. Mini program games mostly
        have the characteristics of repetition, singularity, and addiction. It
        may seem like it takes a long time to play challenge. Audiences can

          The original intention of 'Buy For 秃' was to promote Buy42 charity store to young people. I hope to attract more people to join the warm family of Buy42. We chose the homophones "bald" and "two“ in the hope of resonating with everyone. At the same time, in order to highlight the concept of charity stores the star elements added in the film symbolize that every item has its own value and reflect that Buy42 illuminates our lives. <br>
          In the film, the protagonist is bald and typing on the keyboard day after dayand the heavy workoad makes him ose nis smile. Suddenlyone day he received an invitation from Buy42 as a volunteer so he came to Buy42 without hesitation. In the store he organizes donations andre ceives star payments from customers.<br> During this process, Bald feels his own value. He feels that what he does is meaningful, and his heart is gradually
          healed, gaining a sense of happiness and fulfillment. We want to encourage more young people to step out of the complex work and find places to unleash their owr value through his experience. I hope this short film can bring you joy and resonate with you.

            Let's Draw is a community painting activity project in Nangong. 
            When conducting research in the Nangong community, we found that 
            firstly, the barriers between each community in the Nangong community 
            are very thick, and they do not frequently interact and communicate
            with each other. Secondly, on weekends, there will be many children 
            not only playing in their respective neighborhoods, but also playing 
            and playing together in the Y-shaped alleys in the community. These 
            two points make us ponder whether the barriers between communities can 
            also be broken by children. <br/><br>So we have Let's Draw! Using paintbrushes 
            to introduce the Nangong project, we hope to use children's paintbrushes 
            to help those who have lived in the community for a long time but have not 
            seen it well, calm down and take a serious look at the beautiful little 
            things in the community. Using children's paintings as a topic for 
            communication among residents. <br/><br>Let's Draw is divided into two activities. 
            Activity 1: release tweets, call the children in Nangong Community to draw the 
            objects in the community, and send their pictures to Let us Draw on the official
            account. At the same time, carry out offline activities and invite children to
           paint on-site in the community. Activity 2: Arrange the children's paintings into 
           a detachable collection of works, and upload the collection to the official 
           account. At the same time, paste the children's paintings in the community. 
           This event and the booklet produced have created an opportunity for residents
           of Nangong to exchange ideas, increase topic awareness, and serve as a brochure 
           for Nangong to help residents better understand Nangong. <br/><br>Let's Draw this 
           time! Introducing the Nangong activity with a paintbrush is the beginning of our 
           community project, and we also hope to use Let's Draw in the future! Initiate 
           more community activities as a slogan.
