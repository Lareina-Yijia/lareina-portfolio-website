          I accidentally saw a post, and someone asked, "Does anyone know the
          name of the safe evacuation of the little green person?" Another
          person replied, "Mr. Picto." This post attracted me and prompted me to
          look up the information. This can be traced back to the 1970s, when
          several large fires broke out in Japanese buildings, and the fire
          department believed that there was a lack of a prominent sign that
          could evacuate people in emergency situations, transforming it into a
          sign for mass mobilization. So Mr. Picto was born.
